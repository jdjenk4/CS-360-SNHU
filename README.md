This is a school assignment related to CS-360-17552-M01 Mobile Architect &amp; Programming

1. Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
This was the beginning of an application that provided a login screen, an SMS verification, and a basic table for user data. Continued work on this application would have it be used for scanning items and adding those items to an inventory. The applicaiton would help uer's keep track of inventory levels and alert users when an item in their inventory gets low or runs out.

2. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
A login screen was needed to have users sign in or sign up for the application. Additionally, a button was on the login screen to allow users to send a test SMS verification. The design of the screen was simple with interactive fields plainly labeled.

3. How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
The process of coding the app took on several stages of planning and designing the app before actually coding the elemnts that made up the app. I split the designing of the app into stages to try and make small changes over time so that issues that would pop up could be addressed immediately. This made developing the app easier since issues were default one at a time, over time, instead of all at once.

4. How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
Incremental testing was implemented after each small change to ensure that the code was operating as intended. This also helped identify issues with the code when the errors would pop up, preventing the app from running.

5. Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
The most innovation came about during coding, when some of the UI had to be changed to better fit the screen of a mobile device. Dimensions, intially, looked off and would have lead to an app that seemed incomplete and not user friendly.

6. In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The component I felt the most successful in was abiding by industry standards and best practices. My code was properly formatted and commented to establish the different components and what their intended purpose might be. This makes it easier to revist in the future to make changes or if somebody else were to come along and want to make changes.
